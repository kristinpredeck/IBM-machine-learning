This analysis focuses on predicting a city identity from temperature values. The dataset was obtained from https://data.world/datasets/prediction (Global land temperatures). It contains temperature information for countries from 1750-2015. From this data set a subset for temperature information on major international cities was selected. This csv file has 7 columns (date, average temp, average temp uncertainty, city, country, latitude, longitude). 

The analysis predicts city (Berlin or New York) from average temperature and average temperature uncertainty values.
